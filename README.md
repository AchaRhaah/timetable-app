# Timetable App

This web app is made for SLIIT students of all years and all specializations
The timetables of selected groups/batches have been added by volunteers

## How to use 👇

1. Enter your name/nickname
2. Select your batch/group from the available dropdown lists (only those groups that have been added will be displayed)
3. You'll see the timetable for the current day and ongoing (current) lecture
4. You don't need to enter the details again (the app saves everything in your browser as cookies)
